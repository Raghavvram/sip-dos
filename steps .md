Performing a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) flood attack is a form of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack where the attacker sends a massive number of SIP requests to the target to overwhelm and disable the service.

Here's a general outline of how you might set up a SIP flood attack in your contained environment:

**Disclaimer:** This is for educational purposes only. Never perform such activities on networks or systems that you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
1. **Windows Machine (Victim):**
   - Ensure your Windows machine has a SIP service running. You can use software like [Asterisk](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk) or [FreeSWITCH](https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch).

2. **Kali Linux (Attacker):**
   - Ensure your Kali Linux machine is set up correctly and connected to the same private network as the victim machine.

### Step 2: Install SIPp on Kali Linux
SIPp is a free test tool and traffic generator for the SIP protocol. Install SIPp using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install sipp
```

### Step 3: Prepare SIPp Configuration
You can create a SIPp scenario XML file or use one of the provided examples. For a basic flood attack, you can use the built-in UAC scenario.

### Step 4: Perform the SIP Flood Attack
Use the following command to initiate the SIP flood:
```bash
sipp -sf <scenario_file> -s <SIP_extension> <victim_IP_address> -r <rate_of_requests>
```
- `<scenario_file>`: Path to your SIPp scenario file.
- `<SIP_extension>`: SIP extension to use.
- `<victim_IP_address>`: IP address of your Windows machine.
- `<rate_of_requests>`: Number of requests per second.

Example:
```bash
sipp -sf uac.xml -s 1000 192.168.1.10 -r 500
```
This command sends 500 SIP requests per second to the victim machine at IP 192.168.1.10, using the `uac.xml` scenario.

### Step 5: Monitor the Attack
Keep an eye on the CPU and memory usage on both the victim and attacker machines to see the impact of the attack.

### Step 6: Terminate the Attack
Once you've gathered sufficient data, stop the attack using `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where SIPp is running.
